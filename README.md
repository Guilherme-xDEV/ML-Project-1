# ML-Project-1
In this first project, my objective is to create an Email filter spam. This Machine Larning algorithm is able to detect when an Email is spam based on the words that constitute it.
The core of the algorithm is a naive bayes probabilistic classification method that uses Bayes' Theorem to generate a table of probabilities.
Naive Bayes is widely used in: Natural language processing, Medical diagnostics, Spam classification, Sentiment classification, Recommender systems.

### libraries used:
- pandas, numpy and sklearn

### progress:
-Day 1 (01/01): <br/>
Uploaded the main files.
trying to see ways to make the project more concise for everyday applications, making the algorithm more accurate or add a front-end basic integration?

-Day 2 (02/01)
Added new feature to the code; now the user can input email text to see if it is spam or not.
The model can now evaluate portuguese text, before it could only evaluate text in english <br/>
txt file was improved for that.
I'm considering an integration with HTML and JavaScript code, the user could have their text verified using an input box on a simple website that will display spam or normal.

-Day (03/01)
An error occurred when I tried to combine the English and Portuguese languages ​​in the txt file. Trying to solve the problem and add more lines of text to the txt file.
